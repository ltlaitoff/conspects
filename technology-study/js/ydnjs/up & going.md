When you strive to comprehend your code, you create better work and become better at what you do. The code isn’t just your job anymore, it’s your craft. This is why I love Up & Going.


Hoisting
Wherever a var appears inside a scope, that declaration is taken to
belong to the entire scope and accessible everywhere throughout.
Metaphorically, this behavior is called hoisting, when a var declara‐
tion is conceptually “moved” to the top of its enclosing scope. Tech‐
nically, this process is more accurately explained by how code is
compiled, but we can skip over those details for now.
