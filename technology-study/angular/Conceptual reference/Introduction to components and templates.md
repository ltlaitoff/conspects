A component controls a patch of screen called a view. It consists of a TypeScript class, an HTML template, and a CSS style sheet. The TypeScript class defines the interaction of the HTML template and the rendered DOM structure, while the style sheet describes its appearance.

An Angular application uses individual components to define and control different aspects of the application. For example, an application could include components to describe:
- The application root with the navigation links
- The list of heroes
- The hero editor
