# Answer for Cliff Weitzman

Мені подобається ваш проєкт

У мене не дуже гарний рівень англійської мови, чи може це стати перешкодою?

Я работаю сейчас и мой стек



У меня последняя неделя в университете, and I focused on it

Чи можу я отримати тестове завдання 28 - 01 July?  

Can i get a test task on 01 July?

Hi Cliff!

Wow, I like the Speechify. You and your team do a really good stuff

I have only a B1 level of English. I can easily read, write and listen, but speak... . I have some troubles with it. Could this can be an obstacle?

On now, I work in WinWinTravel, travel startup for fast find a hotel for trip. As you know I live in Ukraine and I can't trip on now, but I will 100% use in future

I work as Team Lead of frontend team with 4 devs + two testing engineers. On my daily basis I'm planning of tasks, do a meets with testing or devs, communication with backend team, and also I wrote code and do default developer tasks

My stack on now is a JavaScript and typescript, react, zustand, Chakra UI, react-query and nx for monorepository
I also have projects on Vue and angular and I can switch to any framework in 1–2 month

I want to say right away, I always try to improve staff I do or see for developers(DX) or clients(UX). I know it's not my work, but why not
Sometimes I can do feature not according to design because I think it can be better, that a UI/UX draw. And in 2/3 of all the times when I did this, my version was better and we left it

Like example, you speechify pricing page :)
From https://speechify.com/pricing/ I can't understand a full price for year of Professional plan of Speechify Studio. You guys can add a full year price right above the month price. It can stimulate user for buy a year subscription 

On now in my University a last week of exams, so I can't call on this week

Can I get a test task on 01 July? And according to the results, we can talk about my knowledge

All my best,
Ivan
