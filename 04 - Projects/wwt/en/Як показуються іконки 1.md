# How the icons are displayed

We have 4 options for which icon to display:
- Option icon. The most priority option. The `iconName` field determines which icon to display
- Feature icon. It is displayed if the option does not have an icon. The `iconName` field determines which icon to display
- Group icon. It is displayed if the feature does not have an icon. The `iconName`(`dev-2`) field determines which icon to display
- General icon. It is displayed if the group does not have an icon

So, we have a **set of general icons** and the `iconName` field should indicate which icon to take

But this option will have disadvantages. We will not be able to make a unique icon for some option
