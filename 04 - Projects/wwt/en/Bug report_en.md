# Bug report

## Summary

The title of the bug report should be as clear as possible to developers, as they will be the ones fixing the bug.

The title should answer 3 questions: `Where?` `What?` `When?`

In some situations, you may not need to follow this structure, for example, if it's a bug in the code that developers understand, but it can't be nicely described.

In some, you can omit some sections, for example, you can skip the `When?` section if it's always), or `Where?` when it's some kind of global bug.

**The point is that the title should be as clear as possible!**

If you think that with these three questions it will be less clear than with them - you can do it your own way.

## Variants

Currently, we have two variants of bug reports:
- `Default` - a regular bug on the `frontend` part. Corresponds to a regular bug in `Jira`.
- `BE-FE` - a bug in the interaction of `frontend` and `backend`. For example, some incorrect field. Corresponds to the `BE-FE bug` type of tasks in `Jira`.

I'm sorry, but you didn't provide any Markdown content to translate. Could you please provide the content you want translated?
